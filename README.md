## 👋 Hi there, I'm Muhammad Sameer

I'm a frontend developer with a focus on building dynamic, high-performance web applications using React and Next.js. I enjoy crafting clean, responsive UIs and leveraging the power of server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for optimized, scalable projects. Passionate about modern web technologies, I aim to create user-friendly and efficient solutions.
